## Today's theme

### [Forehead detective](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/nov/17/party-games-guide)

AKA: The Post-it game, the Rizla game, take your partners
Aim: To work out who you are (and make friends)

#### How to play

There are many variants of this, but the principle remains the same. Everyone has the name of a famous person (fictional or real) stuck on to their back or forehead in a way that everyone can read the name except them. Cigarette papers and sticky memo notes are a good way of doing this. By asking questions with yes/no answers, everyone has to work out who they are.

As guests arrive, issue them with a name, either by pinning it on their back, or giving it to them in a sealed envelope for use later. When everyone is assembled, explain the concept and set them to find who they are.

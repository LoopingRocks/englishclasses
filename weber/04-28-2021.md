### Pictionary

Pictionary is a classic game of drawing and guessing pictures. This game works great with large groups as an icebreaker, as well as simply a fun game to play on a lazy Sunday afternoon with friends.

#### How to Play

Divide the group into teams. Give each team a name. Decide which team goes first.

On a team’s turn, they choose someone to draw. Prepare a one-minute timer. The player says “Go!” and starts the timer. The player begins to draw a picture of the word(s). The goal is for the team to correctly guess the word (or basic idea of the word) within the allotted time limit. If the team correctly guesses the word, they receive a point. Then it’s the next team’s turn.

#### Rules

- The artist may not make any hand gestures or audible noises.
- The pictures drawn cannot have any numbers or letters.
